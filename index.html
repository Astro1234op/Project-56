                <p>The ELEPHENT TRUNK Nebula-The Elephant's Trunk Nebula is a concentration of interstellar gas and dust within the much larger ionized gas region IC 1396 located in the constellation Cepheus about 2,400 light years away from Earth.[1] The piece of the nebula shown here is the dark, dense globule IC 1396A; it is commonly called the Elephant's Trunk nebula because of its appearance at visible light wavelengths, where there is a dark patch with a bright, sinuous rim. The bright rim is the surface of the dense cloud that is being illuminated and ionized by a very bright, massive star (HD 206267) that is just to the east of IC 1396A. (In the Spitzer Space Telescope view shown, the massive star is just to the left of the edge of the image.) The entire IC 1396 region is ionized by the massive star, except for dense globules that can protect themselves from the star's harsh ultraviolet rays.

The Elephant's Trunk Nebula is now thought to be a site of star formation, containing several very young (less than 100,000 yr) stars that were discovered in infrared images in 2003. Two older (but still young, a couple of million years, by the standards of stars, which live for billions of years) stars are present in a small, circular cavity in the head of the globule. Winds from these young stars may have emptied the cavity.

The combined action of the light from the massive star ionizing and compressing the rim of the cloud, and the wind from the young stars shifting gas from the center outward lead to very high compression in the Elephant's Trunk Nebula. This pressure has triggered the current generation of protostars.</p>

                <p>TON 618-TON 618 is a hyperluminous, broad-absorption-line, radio-loud quasar located near the border of the constellations Canes Venatici and Coma Berenices, approximately 10.4 billion light-years from Earth. It possesses one of the most massive black holes ever found, with a mass of 66 billion M☉.[2]</p>

                <p>STEPHENSON 218-Stephenson 2-18 (St2-18), also known as Stephenson 2 DFK 1 or RSGC2-18, is a red supergiant star in the constellation of Scutum. It lies near the open cluster Stephenson 2, which is located about 6,000 parsecs (20,000 ly) away from Earth, and is assumed to be one of a group of stars at a similar distance. It is among the largest known stars, and one of the most luminous red supergiants, with an estimated radius around 2,150 times that of the Sun (R☉), which corresponds to a volume nearly 10 billion times bigger than the Sun. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Saturn.</p>
